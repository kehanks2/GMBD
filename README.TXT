This is the project folder.

I have everything set up in VS Code including git,
which has been installed so that we can easily push changes to the repo.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. After you make a change to a file go to Source Control on the left panel, or Ctrl + Shift + G. 

2. Next, click the + next to each file you changed.

3. Then, click the checkmark at the top of the panel and type in the commit message to push the commit.

4. Finally, Click the second button on the bottom blue task bar (should be to the right of main
and show ( 0 | 1 ).).

That's it!!
